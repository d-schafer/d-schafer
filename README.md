- 👋 Hi, I’m @d-schafer
- 👀 I’m a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the Graduate Center, City University of New York.
- 🌱 I use R (and some Python) for sentiment analysis of textual data and network analysis of social media data. I'm particular interested in the language of political elites in Turkey (I will eventually extend the analysis to other countries).
- 💞️ I'd be very interested in collaborating with computer scientists (or anyone with expertise in natural language processing, especially with langauges like Turkish). I can provide the political theory!
- 📫 You can reach me at dschafer[at]gradcenter[dot]cuny[dot]edu.
