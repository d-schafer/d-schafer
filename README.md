- 👀 I’m a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the Graduate Center, City University of New York.
- 🌱 I use R (and some Python) for sentiment analysis of textual data and network analysis of social media data. I'm interested in the language of political elites, with a focus on Turkey.
- 💞️ I'm always up for collaborating, either with people interested in applying these methods to their region or topic of interest, or with computer scientists (or anyone with expertise in natural language processing).
- 📫 You can reach me at dschafer[at]gradcenter[dot]cuny[dot]edu.
