- 👋 Hi, I’m @d-schafer
- 👀 I’m a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the Graduate Center, City University of New York.
- 🌱 I’m learning to use R (and some Python) for text analysis. I'm particular interested in the language of political elites in Turkey 
      (and then maybe other countries when I got better at this kind of analysis).
- 💞️ I'd be very interested in collaborating with computer scientists (or anyone who knows the programming better than me). I can provide the political theory!
- 📫 You can reach me at dschafer[at]gradcenter[dot]cuny[dot]edu.
