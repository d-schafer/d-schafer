- I completed my PhD in Political Science at the Graduate Center, City University of New York. I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Central European University's Democracy Institute with the project "Neo-Authoritarianisms in EUrope". I will start a position as Assistant Professor at Mississippi State University in the fall of 2024.
 
- I use R (and some Python) for sentiment analysis of textual data and network analysis of social media data. I'm interested in the language of political elites, with a focus on Turkey.
